                Experienced event photographers never leave for a job without backup equipment: extra cameras, batteries, and memory cards. You can't pause an event, so be prepared with essentials like an assortment of lenses, flashes, and even creative tools like prisms. Once you have your essentials, create a customized packing list to streamline your process.
